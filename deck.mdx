# What is react-three-fiber?

React [reconciler](https://github.com/facebook/react/tree/master/packages/react-reconciler)
for ThreeJS on the web and react-native
  
<Steps>

- Created by [Paul Henschel](https://twitter.com/0xca0a), the author of [react-spring](https://www.react-spring.io/)
- Build stuff like [this game](https://i2160.csb.app/)
- With code like [this](https://codesandbox.io/embed/r3f-game-i2160?fontsize=14&hidenavigation=1&theme=dark&view=editor)

</Steps>

# Why do I care about it?

[whiteboard.explaineverything.com](https://whiteboard.explaineverything.com/)

---

# How it works?

Reconcilers translate React's declarative API into underlying platfrom operations.

`react-dom`, `react-native`, `react-three-fiber`, `react-zdog`

---

## `"mesh" --> THREE.Mesh`

---

# The Problem

<Steps>

1. We're using both `react-dom` and `react-three-fiber` in an app (obviously).
2. Both use string instrinsic elements `<div />` `<mesh />`
3. JSX.IntrinsicElements types are global
4. ðŸ’¥ Subsequent property declarations must have the same type. ts(2717)

</Steps>

---


![(property) JSX.IntrinsicElements.line: React.SVGProps<SVGLineElement> Subsequent property declarations must have the same type. Property 'line' must be of type 'SVGProps<SVGLineElement>', but here has type 'Object3DNode<Line, typeof Line>'. ts(2717)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15332326/63222606-96cb0780-c1aa-11e9-98d5-591572090dee.png)

react-three-fiber was a React library written in TypeScript which conflicted
with @types/react

I'm not turning `skipLibCheck` on. [I had to act](https://github.com/react-spring/react-three-fiber/pull/233). 

---

# Conflict with @types/react

---

### How are the elements mapped into ThreeJS objects?

```ts
function createInstance( // simplified
  type: string,
  { args = [], ...props },
  container: THREE.Object3D,
  hostContext: any,
  internalInstanceHandle: Reconciler.Fiber
) {
  let name = `${type[0].toUpperCase()}${type.slice(1)}`
  
  const target = (catalogue as any)[name] || (THREE as any)[name]
  
  return is.arr(args) ? new target(...args) : new target(args)
}
```

full implementation in [react-three-fiber/master/src/reconciler.tsx#L191-L235](https://github.com/react-spring/react-three-fiber/blob/master/src/reconciler.tsx#L191-L235)

---

# How to type this?

---

import liePng from "./assets/lie.png";

<Box>
  <img src={liePng} />
</Box>

---

```js
if (__DEV__ || global.RN$Bridgeless) {
  // On Android, View extends the base component with additional view-only props
  // On iOS, the base component is View
  if (Platform.OS === 'android') {
    viewConfig = ReactNativeViewViewConfigAndroid;
    registerGeneratedViewConfig('RCTView', ReactNativeViewViewConfigAndroid);
  } else {
    viewConfig = {};
    registerGeneratedViewConfig('RCTView', {uiViewClassName: 'RCTView'});
  }

  NativeViewComponent = 'RCTView';
} else {
  NativeViewComponent = requireNativeComponent('RCTView');
}

```
https://github.com/facebook/react-native/blob/master/Libraries/Components/View/ViewNativeComponent.js#L56-L70



React Native lies about the types of builtin components.

# Initial idea

```ts
const t = {
  line: ('line' as any) as ((
    _: ReactThreeFiber.Object3DNode<THREE.Line, typeof THREE.Line>
  ) => JSX.Element),
};

function Thing({ vertices }) {
  return (
      <t.line
        onPointerDown={e => console.log(e)}
        onUpdate={line => console.log(line)}
      >
        <geometry
          attach="geometry"
          vertices={vertices.map(v => new THREE.Vector3(...v))}
          onUpdate={self => (self.verticesNeedUpdate = true)}
        />
        <lineBasicMaterial attach="material" color="black" />
      </t.line>
  );
}
```

Easy, huh?

---

Not easy.

<Steps>

- We have multiple types of "components" (`Object3DNode`, `BufferGeometryNode`)
  depending on the class hierarchy in THREE
- We can't check the inheritance, because THREE is ES5 codebase with "constructor composition"
  instead of prototypal inheritance. 

</Steps>
